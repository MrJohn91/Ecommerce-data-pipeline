# Data Engineering Project

![Architecture Diagram](Arc%20Diagram/Archetecture%20Diagram.png)  

## Overview
The **Data Engineering Project** was developed to address challenges in managing and analyzing large volumes of e-commerce data for an organization operating in 15 countries across North America and Europe. This project focuses on creating a scalable, real-time data pipeline for centralized analytics.

---

## Objective
The goal was to design and implement a data engineering solution using **Azure Data Lake**, **Snowflake**, and a layered architecture to:
- Centralize data from various sources.
- Enable near real-time analytics and reporting.
- Solve data quality, scalability, and processing delay issues.

---

## Problems
The project addresses the following challenges faced by the organization:

1. **Data Silos**:
   - Customer, product, and order data were stored in separate systems, making it difficult to get a unified view of the business.

2. **Processing Delays**:
   - Batch processing caused a 24-hour delay in generating sales reports, hindering real-time decision-making.

3. **Scalability Issues**:
   - The on-premises data warehouse struggled to handle growing data volumes, especially during peak sales periods.

4. **Data Quality**:
   - Inconsistent formats and missing values created errors in reports and analytics.

5. **Analytical Limitations**:
   - The existing setup did not support advanced analytics or machine learning for customer personalization and demand forecasting.

---

## Key Features
1. **End-to-End Data Pipeline**:
   - Data ingestion from **Azure Data Lake** into **Snowflake**.
   - Three-layer architecture: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.
2. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Implemented **streams** and **tasks** in Snowflake to process incremental data changes.
3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Data cleaning, validation, and standardization in the Silver layer.
4. **Business Insights**:
   - Created analytical views for daily sales and customer-product affinity analysis.

---

## Architecture
The project uses the following architecture:
1. **Azure Data Lake (ADLS)**:
   - Centralized storage for raw data from CRM, inventory management, and e-commerce platforms.
2. **Snowflake**:
   - Data warehouse for processing and analytics.
   - Layers:
     - **Bronze**: Raw data.
     - **Silver**: Cleaned and standardized data.
     - **Gold**: Aggregated data for reporting.
3. **Snowflake Streams and Tasks**:
   - Incremental processing for real-time updates.
4. **Gold Layer Views**:
   - Business-ready models for reporting and insights.

---

## Technologies Used
1. **Azure Data Lake (ADLS)**: Storage for raw data ingestion.
2. **Snowflake**:
   - Data Warehouse for centralized analytics.
   - Streams and Tasks for real-time data processing.
3. **SQL**:
   - For writing stored procedures, views, and transformations.
4. **GitHub**:
   - Version control and project tracking.

---

## Data Layers
### Bronze Layer
- Stores raw data ingested from ADLS without transformation.
- Acts as the staging area for further processing.

### Silver Layer
- Applies data validation, cleaning, and standardization.
- Ensures data quality by handling missing values and inconsistencies.

### Gold Layer
- Contains business-ready aggregated data.
- Supports advanced analytics and reporting via views.

---

## Key Analytical Views
1. **Daily Sales Analysis** (`VW_DAILY_SALES_ANALYSIS`):
   - Tracks total sales, transactions, and average prices daily.
   - Provides product and customer insights.

2. **Customer-Product Affinity** (`VW_CUSTOMER_PRODUCT_AFFINITY`):
   - Analyzes customer preferences and spending habits.
   - Highlights product popularity among different customer types.

---

## Achievements
1. **Centralized Architecture**:
   - Unified customer, product, and order data in Snowflake.
2. **Improved Efficiency**:
   - Reduced processing delays with real-time data updates.
3. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Enabled better decision-making with detailed sales and customer analysis.
4. **Data Quality**:
   - Handled inconsistencies and missing data during transformations.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate machine learning models for personalized marketing and demand forecasting.
- Automate anomaly detection in sales data for faster issue resolution.
- Expand the pipeline to include new data sources like social media or external APIs.
